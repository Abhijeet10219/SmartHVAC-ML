 "Optimizing Building Energy Efficiency: Leveraging Machine Learning Models for Enhanced HVAC System Performance"
Reducing building energy consumption, particularly from HVAC systems, is a global challenge that requires strategic optimization of building design parameters. Conventional methods using simulation tools and optimization algorithms are computationally intensive and time-consuming.

To streamline the process, the study leveraged machine learning models trained on a dataset of building design parameters and energy consumption figures. This dataset, provided by researchers from the University of Oxford, allows the models to serve as efficient proxies within the optimization framework, predicting energy consumption for different design configurations.

The project examined both discrete and aggregated energy consumption by heating and cooling systems, highlighting potential avenues for reduction through improved insulation, efficient lighting, and renewable energy integration.

The study evaluated the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest regression, XG Boost, and a custom-designed Neural Network. Ensemble methods like Random Forest Regressor and XG Boost outperformed Linear Regression and the Neural Network model, demonstrating their ability to capture nonlinear feature interactions in complex regression tasks like building energy consumption prediction.

After a thorough comparative analysis, the Random Forest Regressor model was selected as the most suitable for further optimization and deployment, due to its excellent performance balance, ease of interpretation, and simplicity.

This detailed evaluative and selection process ensures the chosen model is optimally configured to accurately predict building energy consumption, contributing to the broader goals of energy efficiency and sustainability in building design.
